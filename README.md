# 06 Server-Side APIs: Weather Dashboard

## Introduction
```
This was the project that I had been fearing ever since learing of its exsistance.
However after starting, and proceeding through this build I began to have alot of fun, and 
while I broke it several times, I found what I believe to be a unique way to write, and use 
APIs, which i'm sure will come in handy in the future!

Display of current weather conditions, forecasts, and other relevant information
User-friendly interface with a mid 2000s feel
